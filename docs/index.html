<p>Caution: Developing this type of software and using data radios successfully is challenging and requires a substantial knowledge base in software and radio and data transmission technologies and theory. It may not be an appropriate project for beginners. If you are a beginner, you will need to spend some time gaining knowledge in these areas first.</p>
<dl class="section user"><dt>Overview</dt><dd></dd></dl>
<p>RadioHead consists of 2 main sets of classes: Drivers and Managers.</p>
<ul>
<li>Drivers provide low level access to a range of different packet radios and other packetized message transports.</li>
<li>Managers provide high level message sending and receiving facilities for a range of different requirements.</li>
</ul>
<p>Every RadioHead program will have an instance of a Driver to provide access to the data radio or transport, and usually a Manager that uses that driver to send and receive messages for the application. The programmer is required to instantiate a Driver and a Manager, and to initialise the Manager. Thereafter the facilities of the Manager can be used to send and receive messages.</p>
<p>It is also possible to use a Driver on its own, without a Manager, although this only allows unaddressed, unreliable transport via the Driver's facilities.</p>
<p>In some specialised use cases, it is possible to instantiate more than one Driver and more than one Manager.</p>
<p>A range of different common embedded microprocessor platforms are supported, allowing your project to run on your choice of processor.</p>
<p>Example programs are included to show the main modes of use.</p>
<dl class="section user"><dt>Drivers</dt><dd></dd></dl>

Caution: although RadioHead compiles with nRF52832 as at 2020-03-12 there appears to be a problem with the support of interupt handlers in the Sparkfun support libraries, and drivers (ie most of the other SPI based radio drivers) that require interrupts do not work correctly.</li>
<li><a class="el" href="classRH__RF95.html" title="Driver to send and receive unaddressed, unreliable datagrams via a LoRa capable radio transceiver.">RH_RF95</a> Works with Semtech SX1276/77/78/79, Modtronix inAir4 and inAir9, and HopeRF RFM95/96/97/98 and other similar LoRa capable radios.

</ul>
<p>Drivers can be used on their own to provide unaddressed, unreliable datagrams. All drivers have the same identical API. Or you can use any Driver with any of the Managers described below.</p>
<p>We welcome contributions of well tested and well documented code to support other transports.</p>
<p>If your radio or transciever is not on the list above, there is a good chance it wont work without modifying RadioHead to suit it. If you wish for support for another radio or transciever, and you send 2 of them to AirSpayce Pty Ltd, we will consider adding support for it.</p>
<dl class="section user"><dt>Managers</dt><dd></dd></dl>

CAUTION: The GHz radio included in the ESP8266 is not yet supported. CAUTION: tests here show that when powered by an FTDI USB-Serial converter, the ESP8266 can draw so much power when transmitting on its GHz WiFi that VCC will sag causing random crashes. We strongly recommend a large cap, say 1000uF 10V on VCC if you are also using the WiFi.</li>

<p>Other platforms are partially supported, such as Generic AVR 8 bit processors, MSP430. We welcome contributions that will expand the range of supported platforms.</p>

<dl class="section user"><dt>History</dt><dd></dd></dl>
<p>RadioHead was created in April 2014, substantially based on code from some of our other earlier Radio libraries:</p>

<p>During this combination and redevelopment, we have tried to retain all the processor dependencies and support from the libraries that were contributed by other people. However not all platforms can be tested by us, so if you find that support from some platform has not been successfully migrated, please feel free to fix it and send us a patch.</p>

<p>The Photon is not supported by the Arduino IDE, so it takes a little effort to set up a build environment.

<dl class="section user"><dt>Coding Style</dt><dd></dd></dl>
<p>RadioHead is designed so it can run on small processors with very limited resources and strict timing contraints. As a result, we tend only to use the simplest and least demanding (in terms of memory and CPU) C++ facilities. In particular we avoid as much as possible dynamic memory allocation, and the use of complex objects like C++ strings, IO and buffers. We are happy with this, but we are aware that some people may think we are legaving useful tools on the table. You should not use this code as an example of how to do generalised C++ programming on well resourced processors.</p>

1.65 2017-01-11 Fixed a race condition with <a class="el" href="classRH__NRF51.html" title="Send and receive unaddressed, unreliable datagrams by nRF51 and nRF52 compatible transceivers.">RH_NRF51</a> that prevented ACKs being reliably received.<br  />
 Removed code in <a class="el" href="classRH__NRF51.html" title="Send and receive unaddressed, unreliable datagrams by nRF51 and nRF52 compatible transceivers.">RH_NRF51</a> that enabled the DC-DC converter. This seems not to be a necessary condition for the radio to work and is now left to the application if that is required.<br  />
 Proven interoperation between nRF51822 and nRF52832.<br  />
 Modification and testing of <a class="el" href="classRH__NRF51.html" title="Send and receive unaddressed, unreliable datagrams by nRF51 and nRF52 compatible transceivers.">RH_NRF51</a> so it works with nRF52 family processors, such Sparkfun nRF52832 breakout board, with Arduino 1.6.13 and Sparkfun nRF52 boards manager 0.2.3 using the procedures outlined in <a href="https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/nrf52832-breakout-board-hookup-guide">https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/nrf52832-breakout-board-hookup-guide</a><br  />
 Caution, the Sparkfun development system for Arduino is still immature. We had to rebuild the nrfutil program since the supplied one was not suitable for the Linux host we were developing on. See <a href="https://forum.sparkfun.com/viewtopic.php?f=32&t=45071">https://forum.sparkfun.com/viewtopic.php?f=32&amp;t=45071</a> Also, after downloading a sketch in the nRF52832, the program does not start executing cleanly: you have to reset the processor again by pressing the reset button. This appears to be a problem with nrfutil, rather than a bug in RadioHead. </dd>

1.67 2017-01-24 Added <a class="el" href="classRH__RF95.html#a96154a00662d73f69b9858597c8d4c9b">RH_RF95::frequencyError()</a> to return the estimated centre frequency offset in Hz of the last received message </dd>

<dd>
1.73 2017-03-04 Significant changes to <a class="el" href="classRH__RF24.html" title="Driver to send and receive unaddressed, unreliable datagrams via an RF24 and compatible radio transce...">RH_RF24</a> and its API. It is no longer possible to change the modulation scheme programatically: it proved impossible to cater for all the possible crystal frequencies, base frequency and modulation schemes. Instead you can use one of a small set of supplied radio configuration header files, or generate your own with Silicon Labs WDS application. Changing modulation scheme required editing RH_RF24.cpp to specify the appropriate header and recompiling. convert.pl is now redundant and removed from the distribution. </dd>
<dd>
1.74 2017-03-08 Changed <a class="el" href="classRHReliableDatagram.html" title="RHDatagram subclass for sending addressed, acknowledged, retransmitted datagrams.">RHReliableDatagram</a> so it would not ACK messages heard addressed to other nodes in promiscuous mode.<br  />

 Improvements to <a class="el" href="classRH__RF69.html#abfa6b11713f416b58f32242791dc8700">RH_RF69::setTxPower</a> so it now takes an optional ishighpowermodule flag to indicate if the connected module is a high power RFM69HW, and so set the power level correctly.

 Testing with the very excellent Rocket Scream boards equipped with RF95 TCXO modules. The temperature controlled oscillator stabilises the chip enough to be able to use even the slowest protocol Bw125Cr48Sf4096. Caution, the TCXO model radios are not low power when in sleep (consuming about ~600 uA, reported by Phang Moh Lim).<br  />
 Added support for EBYTE E32-TTL-1W and family serial radio transceivers. These RF95 LoRa based radios can deliver reliable messages at up to 7km measured. </dd>
